The file radio.png is a replacement for the file of the same name distributed with SBS. It is made to match the style of the other top-level icons for use on the home list of this Crestron module. To use it, replace the existing file with this version (must be done after every upgrade of SBS).

For example, on Ubuntu, I use the following command (in which you must substitute the actual file location for <original_file_location>):
sudo cp <original_file_location> /usr/share/squeezeboxserver/HTML/Default/html/images/radio.png
